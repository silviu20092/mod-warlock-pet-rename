# Warlock pet rename mod

Warlock pet names are automatically generated and can't ever be changed. This mod breaks this rule and allows warlocks to change their pet's name. You need to have your pet summoned when trying to rename it.

Use .npc add 200002 to spawn the NPC.

## How to install

Simply clone the repository and add mod-warlock-pet-rename to the modules folder. Re-run cmake and rebuild the project. The .sql files should be imported automatically, if not then you should manually apply them.
